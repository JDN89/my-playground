## steps to LEARN WASM + LEPTOS
### read docs (BORING, but what can you do?)

### PROJECTS:
- make snake in JS and then in Leptos
	- steps:
		- Set up the game canvas: Create a canvas element in your HTML file and use JavaScript to get its context, set its width and height, and clear it before each frame.

    		- Set up the game loop: Use requestAnimationFrame to create a loop that updates the game state and redraws the canvas every frame.

    		- Create the snake: Define the initial position and size of the snake, and create an array to store its body segments. Move the snake by updating the position of its head and adding a new body segment at the front.

    		- Add food: Generate a random position for the food and check for collisions with the snake. If the snake eats the food, increase its size and generate a new food.

     		- Handle user input: Use the keyboard or touch events to allow the user to control the snake's direction.

    		- Detect collisions: Check for collisions between the snake and the walls or its own body. If the snake collides with something, end the game.

    		- Update the score: Keep track of the player's score based on the number of food items eaten.

    		- Add game over screen: When the game ends, display a message to the user and allow them to restart the game.

- make I love Hue in JS and then in Leptos
